Introduction
============

Multiple tiers of government are set up in geographically vast countries with heterogeneous populations with the belief that they enable efficiency and equity for the provision of public goods through co-operation, co-ordination and competition between central and sub-national governments through a pre-defined set of rules, preferably through a constitutional arrangement. In India there are three tiers of government: Union, State and Local. Local Bodies are both rural and urban. Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are in turn of three types namely Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils and Nagar Panchayats & suburban government bodies. 

Each of these tiers has constitutionally mandated responsibilities to raise resources and spend them. An annual statement of receipts and expenditure are presented by all tiers of government which together constitute government budget in India.

How is a Household Budget different from a Government Budget?
-------------------------------------------------------------

* A household's income is ascertained before spending occurs. A government, on the other hand, estimates its expenditure requirements before it seeks mobilization of resources to meet the same.

* The size of a government budget is dependent on a number of complex factors like requirements of the society and government priorities. For a household, the decision on the size of the budget is based on the estimates of the members.

* Sources of borrowing are quite different when it comes to the government and the private households. Private households have limited capacity to meet unexpected and unforeseen expenditures and have limited sources of borrowing funds. The government, on its part, can borrow from various sources to meet the gap between its spending and its non-debt revenue.

* Managing and sustainability of deficits.

* The motive for budgeting is also different for the private household and the government.

The budget documents like Annual Financial Statement, Detailed Demand for Grants etc. contain information for 3 years. For instance, Union Budget 2017-18 will contain figures for 2015-16 Actuals, 2016-17 Budget Estimates, 2016-17 Revised Estimates and 2017-18 Budget Estimates.
Budget Estimates or BE refers to the allocation of expenditure over the next financial year (March 1, 2017 – April 30, 2018). 

Revised Estimates or RE refers to the actual expenditure of the current financial year (2016-17) for the first 6-7 months and the estimated expenditure for the remaining months in the year.

The term ‘Actuals’ refers to the unaudited final expenditure for the previous financial year.
