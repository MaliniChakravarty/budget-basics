How does an average Budget Cycle look like?

Preparation of the Budget
-------------------------

By convention, the Union Budget for next financial year is presented in Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister on the last working day of February. This year, however, the date for presentation of the budget has been advanced to the first day of February. The process of budget formulation starts in the last week of August or the first fortnight of September. To get the process started, the Budget Division in the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance issues the annual budget circular to all the Union government ministries/departments around August/September. The Circular contains detailed instructions for these ministries/departments on the form and content of the statement of budget estimates to be prepared by them. 

Earlier, the union ministries would provide estimates for plan expenditure to finalise budget estimates for the next financial year, only after they had discussed their respective plan schemes with the Central Planning Commission. Then the Planning Commission would depend on the Finance Ministry to arrive at the Gross Budgetary Support. This would be provided in the budget for the next annual plan of the Union government. In principle, the size of each annual plan should be derived from the approved size of the overall Five-Year Plan (12th Five-Year Plan, 2012-13 to 2016-17, in the present instance). However, in practice, the size of the gross budgetary support for an annual plan also depends on the expected availability of funds with the finance ministry for the next financial year.


Major Changes from 2017 onwards
-------------------------------

Beginning from 2017, this entire process will be advanced by a month and the announcement of budget will be at the very first week of February. Further, the Central Planning Commission has been replaced by the NITI Aayog that has no role in budget formulation. Plan and Non-Plan distinction will also be done away with from 2017 Union Budget onwards. This new scheme would be applicable to the Union Budget and at least for some of the state budgets as well.


What are the Union Budget Documents? 
------------------------------------

Article 112 of the Constitution mandates the Union Government to lay before both the Houses of Parliament a statement of receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for that year, referred to as the 'Annual Financial Statement'. The important budget documents are:

* Annual Financial Statement
* Key to Budget Documents 
* Budget Highlights 
* Budget Speech
* Budget at a Glance
* Finance Bill
* Memorandum
* Receipt Budget
* Expenditure Budget
* Customs & Central Excise Notifications
* The Macro Economic Framework Statement 
* The Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement 
* The Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement 
* Statement of Revenue Foregone 
* Implementation of Budget Announcements 


What are the categories of government accounts?
-----------------------------------------------

There are three major categories of government accounts:

* Consolidated Fund: The Consolidated Fund under Article 266(1) is what is usually known as the budget. It contains all receipts raised by government, money borrowed and receipts from loans given by government. Expenditures for different purposes (other than certain exceptional items which are met from Contingency Fund and Public Account) are incurred from this account. 

* Contingency Fund: The Contingency Fund is constituted under Article 267 of the Constitution of India and is a Rs 500 crores fund which is at the disposal of the President of India. It is for urgent or unforeseen expenditures which do not require prior legislative approval as opposed to the Consolidated Fund. 

* Public Account: The Public Account constituted under Article 266(1) of the Constitution is the government’s function as a custodian of the public money. People can deposit money with the government in the form of provident funds, small savings, etc. which does not belong to it and is to be paid back to the depositors on demand.


What are the components of the Consolidated Fund of India?
----------------------------------------------------------

The Consolidated Fund has Revenue and Capital Accounts which differ from each other based on assets generated or liabilities incurred. There are expenditures and receipts under both accounts.

**Revenue Account**

Any expenditure that doesn’t create assets or reduce liabilities is treated as Revenue Expenditure.  e.g.: salaries, subsidies and interest payments, etc.
Proceeds from taxes, non-tax sources and other receipts are recorded as Revenue Receipts. e.g.: income tax, corporation tax, union excise duty, etc.

**Capital Account**

Any expenditure incurred for the purpose of creation of permanent assets or reduction of recurring liabilities is recorded as Capital Expenditure. Capital Receipts include receipts of a capital nature to be applied so as to set off capital expenditure. It results in an increase in liabilities or a reduction in assets.

**Contingency Fund**

Under Article 267(2) of the Constitution, in addition to the Consolidated Fund, there is a Contingency Fund

**Public Account**

Public Account consists of Deposits and Advances in which the government is merely a custodian of the account and has a liability to repay.

**Voted and Charged Expenditure**

Expenditure that has to be authorised by the legislature/parliament is Voted Expenditure while that which is automatically debited from the Consolidated Fund of India is called Charged Expenditure. E.g.: interest payments, salaries of the President, Lok Sabha speaker, etc. cannot be voted upon in the Parliament.


Money Flow

Where Does the Money Come From?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Gross Tax Collection expected by the Centre is Rs. 100, around Rs. 30 is from Corporation Tax, Rs. 21 from Income Tax, Rs. 14 from Customs, Rs. 19.5 from Union Excise Duties and Rs. 14 from Service Tax.

.. image:: images/ub_receipt_budget.png

Upto 52% of the Union Government’s receipts are from direct tax sources like Corporation and Income Taxes while 48 percent are from indirect sources like Customs, Union Excise Duties and Service Taxes. 

If the States’ receipts are also included, almost two-thirds of Combined Receipts of Centre and States are from Indirect Taxes. Direct Taxes are those for which the burden of tax falls on the entity that is being taxed while Indirect Taxes are those for which tax-burden can be shifted or passed on to others, at least partially,  later through business transactions of goods/services. Examples of some Direct Taxes are Corporation Tax, Income Tax, etc. while Indirect Taxes include Customs Duties, Excise Duties, Service Tax and Sales Tax/Value Added Tax (VAT). Of all these taxes, Union Government has the constitutional responsibility to collect Corporation Tax, Income Tax, Customs Duties and Service Taxes and Union Excise Duties.

**Corporation Tax:** 
Levied on incomes of registered companies/corporations in the territory of India (whether national or multinational/foreign). National companies are taxed on the basis of their aggregate income, irrespective of its source and origin whereas foreign companies are taxed only on the income that arises from operations carried out in India.

**Income Tax:** 
Levied on the income of individuals, firms, etc. other than Companies under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Union Excise Duty: A production tax imposed on goods manufactured in India for domestic consumption by the Union Government under the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the Central Excise Tariff Act. From 1999 onwards, it has been called the Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). Certain goods like alcohol and related products as well as narcotics substances are included under the State Excise Duty and collected by all states.

**Service Tax:**
Levied on services provided by an entity and the responsibility of payment of tax lies on the service provider.
The new proposed Goods and Service Taxes (GST) includes both Excise Duties and Service Taxes.


Where Does the Money Go?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Union Budget has a total allocation of Rs. 100, this is how the government intends to spend that money.

**Interest Payments** include those on internal debt like Treasury Bills, Market Loans, securities issued against small savings collection, state provident funds and insurance and pension funds.

**Defence expenditure** includes those on various aspects of the Army, Navy and Air Force in terms of miscellaneous services like Rashtriya Rifles, J&K Light Infantry, Coast Guard and Research and Development; revenue expenditures like pay and allowances, transportation, stores; and capital outlay on construction, air craft and aero engine, vehicles, equipment, naval fleet and dockyards, etc. This does not include defence pension which is calculated separately under the allocation for pension.

**Pension** consists of those other than as part of welfare and social security like those on widows, mothers, aged and persons with disabilities. It includes the expenditure on central government employees in various departments.

**Subsidies** consist of those on food, fertiliser, petrol and petroleum products, and interest subsidies.

**Finance Commission Recommended Grants-in-Aid** to States consist of 42% of the total of taxes like corporation tax, income tax, customs duty, union excise duty, service tax, etc. which are collected by the Centre which is constitutionally mandated by the Finance Commission to be shared with the states. The total fiscal space available with the Union Government is net of this amount.

The rest of the money is allocated between all the Union Ministries.


Fiscal Deficit
--------------

Fiscal Deficit refers to a gap in government’s budget; a gap that arises in any financial year when the government’s total expenditure exceeds its total income in that year and consequently it borrows money to cover that gap. Unlike the budgets of individuals or households (where income determines our expenditure), in the government budget – it’s the expenditure commitments that should determine its income (i.e. tax revenue and other receipts, which don’t have to be repaid) and the amount to be borrowed (if needed). It is covered by borrowing or taking debt. However, the total borrowing or debt taken by the government in a financial year could be more than the level of the Fiscal Deficit; this is because some of the financial liabilities (or amounts that have to be repaid) under government designed mechanisms like National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) and Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) do not come under Fiscal Deficit (as those mechanisms operate outside the government budget) but those are considered to be the government’s liabilities or debt. The Central and State Governments in India both finance their deficits mostly through borrowing from domestic sources.
